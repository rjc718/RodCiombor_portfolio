    <p class="paragraph_text">TripSmart 
      has several divisions of customer service to assist you in planning and making 
      reservations for your trip, shopping for your trip wardrobe and providing expert 
      guide services. Give us a call and we will be happy to connect you with one 
      of the following departments: <a href="#reservations">Reservations</a>, <a href="#outfitters">Travel Outfitters</a>, or <a href="#tours">Escorted Tours</a>. 
      If you are not quite ready to talk with one of our departments and would prefer 
      doing some of your own research first, may we suggest beginning with our <a href="#links">Helpful 
        Links in Travel Planning</a>.</p>
    <p><span class="list_term"><a href="#reservations" id="reservations"></a>Reservations</span><br>
      <span class="paragraph_text">Our Reservations Department is staffed with five Certified Travel Agents, 
        each of whom is eager to assist you in making your travel plans. They have specialty 
        areas in Africa, the Caribbean, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, 
        Asia, Antarctica, and Hawaii and the South Pacific. They also specialize in 
        Senior Travel, Family Travel, Student Travel, and Special Needs Travel. Call 
        us at <i>(555) 848-0807</i> extension 75 or e-mail us at <i><a href="mailto:mailbox@tripsmart.com">Reservations</a></i> to begin making your travel plans now. We will be happy to send you brochures 
        and listings of Internet addresses to help you get started. We are open from 
        8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. CST.</span></p>
    <p><span class="list_term"><a href="#outfitters" id="outfitters"></a>Travel Outfitters</span><br>
      <span class="paragraph_text">Our travel outfitters are seasoned travelers that have accumulated a vast amount 
        of knowledge in appropriate travel clothing and accessories for specific destinations. 
        Climate and seasons, of course, are important factors in planning your wardrobe 
        for a trip. Area customs should also be taken in consideration so as not to 
        offend the local residents with inappropriate dress. When traveling abroad, 
        we always hope that our customers will represent our country well as good ambassadors. 
        If they can be comfortable and stylish at the same time, we have succeeded! 
        Our clothing is all affordable and packs well on long trips. Most can be washed 
        easily in a hotel sink and hung to drip-dry overnight. Browse through our <a href="catalog.html">on-line 
          catalog</a>, then give us a call at <i>(555) 433-7844</i> extension 85. We will 
        also be happy to mail you a catalog of our extensive collection of travel clothing 
        and accessories.</span></p>
    <p><span class="list_term"> <a href="#tours" id="tours"></a>Escorted Tours</span><br>
      <span class="paragraph_text">Our Escorted Tours department is always hard at work planning the next exciting 
        destination to offer our TripSmart customers. We have seven professional tour 
        guides that accompany our guests from the United States point of departure to 
        their point of return. </span></p>
    <p class="paragraph_text">Our current 
      feature package tour is to Peru. Our local escort is Don Eugene. Don has traveled 
      Peru extensively and enjoys sharing his love for this exciting country with 
      others. He will be 
      assisted after arrival in Peru with the services of archeologist JoAnne Rife, 
      anthropologist Christina Elizabeth, and naturalist 
      Iris Albert. Call us at <i>(555) 848-0807</i> extension 95 for information on the Peru trip or to learn 
      about other destinations being currently scheduled.    </p>
