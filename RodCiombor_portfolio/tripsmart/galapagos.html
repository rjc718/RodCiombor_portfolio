    <h1>Destination:  The Gal&aacute;pagos</h1>
    <p class="paragraph_text"><img src="assets/iguana_and_lizard.jpg" alt="lizard with iguana" width="238" height="255" class="img_left_float" />We  have a really special trip planned for next February. We have reserved ten  cabins on the ship <em>The Wanderer</em> to  explore the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands. The departure date is February 5 and the return  date is February 21. This trip of a lifetime begins in Guayaquil, Ecuador.  Guayaquil is a seaport on the southern coast of Ecuador. You will find it a  vibrant center for business and tourism with lots of sites to explore. Stroll  along the riverfront to enjoy colorful shops, lush parks, and street  entertainment. After a night's rest, you will board your flight to Baltra Island in the Gal&aacute;pagos archipelago.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_text"><img src="assets/blue_footed_booby.jpg" alt="blue-footed booby" width="288" height="222" class="img_right_float" />After  arriving at Baltra's airport, you will board a bus for a  short ride to the dock. Here you will  find a welcoming committee of iguanas and sea lions. These natives love to sun on the docks and don't  seem to mind sharing them with you as long as you don't come too close! <em>The Wanderer</em> is an exquisite touring  ship   licensed to explore the Gal&aacute;pagos by the Ecuadoran government. Tourism to the  Gal&aacute;pagos is strictly regulated for the protection of the land, waters, and  wildlife. You will use pangas for wet and dry landings to observe the  wonderful variety of species of flora and fauna unique to the Gal&aacute;pagos, including the famous  blue-footed booby. You will also have opportunities to swim, snorkel, and  kayak with penguins. When your time on the ship ends, you will fly  to Quito, the second-highest capital city in the world. Quito is a UNESCO World Heritage Site  with beautiful colonial architecture. We recommend taking an extra day to explore its rich history and sample Ecuadoran cuisine.</p>
    <p class="paragraph_text">To  provide the finest in personal attention, this tour will be limited to no more  than twenty people. The price schedule is as follows: Land Tour and  Supplemental Group Air, $5,500.00; International Air, $1,350.00; and Single  Supplement, $1,000.00. Entrance fees, hotel taxes, and services are included in  the Land Tour price. Ship gratuities are also included for the Wanderer crew  and guides. A deposit of $500.00 is required at the time the booking is made.  Trip insurance and luggage insurance are optional and are also offered for an  extra charge. A passport and visa will be required for entry into Ecuador. Call  us at 555-555-0807 for further information and the complete itinerary from 8:00  a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (Central Standard Time).</p>
